# smf_upload_with_sparkle

This lane uploads the .dmg file with Sparkle.

### Example
Uploads the .dmg to Sparkle.
```
smf_upload_with_sparkle(
    build_variant: "alpha",                     # The currently building build variant
    scheme: <scheme>,                         
    sparkle_dmg_path: <path to file>,           # The Path to the .dmg file
    sparkle_upload_user: <>,
    sparkle_upload_url: <>,
    sparkle_version: <>,
    sparkle_signing_team: <>,
    sparkle_xml_name: <>
)
``` 

### Custom Sparkle Credentials for MacOS-Apps

If you want to add a custom Credential for the sparkle upload, follow these steps:
1. Add the credential in Jenkins, give it a meaningful name. For this tutorial Lets say you named it `new_jenkins_credential_key`.
2. In the Config.json in the `project.custom_credentials` section add the following entry:

```
{
    "project" : {
        ...,
        "custom_credentials": {
            ..., 
            "<env_variable_name_for_credential>": {      \
                "name" : "new_jenkins_credential_key",   |____ this section should be added
                "type" : "<credential type>"             |
            },                                           /
    },
    "build_variants" : { ... }
}
```
 `<env_variable_name_for_credential>` will be the name of the env variable in which the credential will be stored during runtime to be used by fastlane.
 
 **Type**: There are (so far) two possible crendential types:
 
    "string"    : The credential is a simple string, a API-Token for example. You want to use this in the most of the cases.
    "file"      : The credential is stored in a file, for example an ssh key. 
    
 3. In each build variant which should use the newly added credential as sparkle key do the following: In the build variants `sparkle` section add the environment variable name (`<env_variable_name_for_credential>`  from step two) as `signing_key`. Like this:
 
```
{
   "project" : {
       ...,
       "custom_credentials": {
           ..., 
           "<env_variable_name_for_credential>": {      
               "name" : "new_jenkins_credential_key",   
               "type" : "<credential type>"             
           },                                          
   },
   "build_variants" : { 
       ...,
       "your_build_variant" : {
            ...,
            "sparkle" : {
                "signing_key" : "<env_variable_name_for_credential>",      # insert the env key name here
                ...
            }
       }
   }
}
```

Now your all done üéâ. When building the edited build variant, fastlane will use the added credential üëè.

#### Custom Credential Example
Lets say you added the following token in Jenkins as a credential:

PARTY_API_TOKEN = "e58f98ab80c98d98e"

Config.json:

```
{
   "project" : {
       ...,
       "custom_credentials": {
           ..., 
           "PARTY_API_TOKEN_KEY": {      
               "name" : "PARTY_API_TOKEN",   
               "type" : "string"            # because its just a simple string       
           },                                          
   },
   "build_variants" : { 
       ...,
       "your_party_build_variant" : {
            ...,
            "sparkle" : {
                "signing_key" : "PARTY_API_TOKEN_KEY",
                ...
            }
       }
   }
}
```

Now your all set üéâ Party hard ü•≥
